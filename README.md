DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION: For Task-4 of the CODTECH internship, the objective was to create an AI-based Recommendation System using Java and libraries like Apache Mahout. The goal was to develop a Java-based program capable of analyzing user preferences and recommending items accordingly, mimicking the systems used by platforms like Amazon, Netflix, or Spotify.

This task demanded an understanding of machine learning principles, collaborative filtering algorithms, and open-source data science libraries that can be integrated into Java applications.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

Java SE (Standard Edition)
Java was used as the primary programming language due to its flexibility, readability, and support for third-party libraries. The basic implementation involved user-item matrices and collaborative filtering logic, which are central to recommender systems.

Apache Mahout
Apache Mahout is an open-source machine learning library primarily used for building scalable recommendation engines. Though Mahout is now more focused on Scala, its earlier versions provided strong Java support and utilities like:

DataModel for reading user preferences from a file.

UserSimilarity and UserNeighborhood for collaborative filtering.

Recommender interface to generate item suggestions.

BlueJ IDE
BlueJ was used for writing and testing the Java code. BlueJ‚Äôs simplified interface is perfect for modular programming and visualizing object-oriented structures. It also allows us to observe terminal outputs and run test cases easily.
